# Research Infrastructure Roles

# Research software engineer

[LCRDM report](https://zenodo.org/records/15052095):

The role of RSEs varies across Dutch institutions and projects. Some are deeply embedded in research teams, **developing new software and advising researchers** ... Others focus on **support and training, guiding researchers on software best practices**, including version control, testing, documentation, and FAIR principles.

*This variety in roles reflects the diverse ways institutions have implemented RSE positions, tailored to their local research needs.*

::: {.notes}

This roles (and research support roles in general) are hard to capture with a single title, so why should you?

# Other roles

Data wrangler, Research application manager, data steward

## Data wrangler

![](images/data-wrangler.jpg){height="450" fig-align="center"}

::: {.notes}

- Data retrieval (scraping, databases), wrangling, analysis
- Data pipelines and infrastructure (+ privacy and security)

# And in practice? {visibility="hidden"}

Constraints

- Funding might not allow for hiring specialist roles
- Ongoing projects require a number of specific skills
- Needs might change, projects and people come and go

# Research engineer @ FMG

Crossover of RSE, data wrangler, research application manager

[Matthijs Moed (SURF)](https://blog.esciencecenter.nl/open-science-festival-what-infrastructures-do-we-need-to-preserve-research-software-7c181404f310)

> At SURF, we build tools that fit in the workflow of researchers. Our biggest challenge is finding out what researchers actually need and how they can use our tools in their work.

**That's the role research engineers have to take**

# Research Engineering Service @ FMG

- Consultancy: < 1 hour
- Short-term projects: days/weeks
- Long-term projects: infrastructure development

---

[UU research engineers](https://www.uu.nl/en/research/research-data-management/support/research-engineers)

*We act as a **knowledge hub** where expertise gained in temporary projects are safeguarded and used for cross-pollination across domains. At the same time, we provide a collaborative community for researchers and IT staff at Utrecht University.*

::: {.notes}

This term applies to our service too

# What is research software?

From the LCRDM report:

*it \[research software] **contains the research process**: data is collected, read, preprocessed, analyzed, visualized and simulated using research software*


# Decision tree {visibility="hidden"}

- Find existing software/solution; promote
- Preferrably open-source and active
- Find the developers/maintainers; connect
- Proof of concept for current case
- Extend/Improve existing software
- Build custom script/software

# Proof of concepts {visibility="hidden"}

- Be ready for when there's a need
- Lab philosophy: experimenting, testing
- Modular! 
    - Small independent components that can be stacked together if needed

::: {.notes}
What's the point of having one complex piece of software if the project ends. 
:::

# Demo: SCED-meta {visibility="hidden"}

Database(s) for meta studies
- What are their needs, skills, budget?

Turns out that other projects needed a similar solution

- cheap database, easy to maintain
- 2FA on Research Cloud
- website (hosting)
