# Research Infrastructure Roles

# Research software engineer

[LCRDM report](https://zenodo.org/records/15052095):

The role of RSEs varies across Dutch institutions and projects. Some are deeply embedded in research teams, **developing new software and advising researchers** ... Others focus on **support and training, guiding researchers on software best practices**, including version control, testing, documentation, and FAIR principles.

*This variety in roles reflects the diverse ways institutions have implemented RSE positions, tailored to their local research needs.*

::: {.notes}
This role (and research support roles in general) are hard to capture with a single title

:::

# Other roles

Data wrangler, Research application manager, data steward

## Data wrangler

![](images/data-wrangler.jpg){height="450" fig-align="center"}

::: {.notes}

- Data retrieval (scraping, databases), wrangling, analysis
- Data pipelines and infrastructure (+ privacy and security)

# And in practice? {visibility="hidden"}

Constraints

- Funding might not allow for hiring specialist roles
- Ongoing projects require a number of specific skills
- Needs might change, projects and people come and go

# Research engineer @ FMG

Crossover of RSE, data wrangler, research application manager

[Matthijs Moed (SURF)](https://blog.esciencecenter.nl/open-science-festival-what-infrastructures-do-we-need-to-preserve-research-software-7c181404f310)

> At SURF, we build tools that fit in the workflow of researchers. Our biggest challenge is finding out what researchers actually need and how they can use our tools in their work.

**That's the role of research engineers**

# Research Engineering Service @ FMG

- Consultancy: < 1 hour
- Short-term projects: days/weeks
- Long-term projects: infrastructure development

---

*We act as a **knowledge hub** where expertise gained in temporary projects are safeguarded and used for cross-pollination across domains. At the same time, we provide a collaborative community for researchers and IT staff at Utrecht University.*

[UU research engineers](https://www.uu.nl/en/research/research-data-management/support/research-engineers)

---

Our **knowledge hub**: recent examples

- internal database, research cloud, android app
- proof of concepts

::: {.notes}
- database: duckdb; for small projects with tight budgets
    - ended up not using it for this project, but it is now part of our "knowledge hub"
- research cloud: cost-efficient way to deploy web applications, collaborate
- anroid app for controlling movement sensors
- PoC: be ready for when there's a need; modular: small independent components that can be stacked together if needed
:::

# Decision tree {visibility="hidden"}

- Find existing software/solution; promote
- Preferrably open-source and active
- Find the developers/maintainers; connect
- Proof of concept for current case
- Extend/Improve existing software
- Build custom script/software

# What is research software?

From the LCRDM report:

*it \[research software] **contains the research process**: data is collected, read, preprocessed, analyzed, visualized and simulated using research software*

## Software is a form of data

- can be stored, loaded, processed
- used as input or output (of other software)
- but: it is a complex type of data
    - context
    - dependencies
    - maintenance

::: {.notes}
- can only be interpreted in the context of what it does, not on its content alone (-> instructions)
- it is usually dependent on other software (components)
- requires [maintenance](https://esciencecenter-digital-skills.github.io/research-software-support/modules/researchsoftware/slides-software#/4/4), is dynamic

# Software as components of instruments

[Blog](https://blog.esciencecenter.nl/defining-the-roles-of-research-software-21535a43f23)

- instruments: MRI-scanner, data donation (virtual)
- software components: UI, server, database, ...

*Or more generally, research software components organize, serve, and provide access to data*

# Infrastructure software vs. software infrastructure

- compilers and programming languages
- generic software libraries
- code repositories, data repositories
- and open source software in general

---

*Free, publicly available source code is the infrastructure on which all of digital society relies. It is vital to the functioning of governments, private companies, and individual lives.*

```{dot}
digraph G {
    notebook -> javascript;
    pandas -> numpy
    numpy -> python;
    ipk [label="ipython-kernel"];
    ipk -> python;
    tornado -> python;
    python -> os;
    os [label="windows/linux/macOS"];
    os -> platform;
    platform [label="?"];
}
```

---

The "?" can be

- a laptop
- a cloud service
- a container (software infrastructure software?)
- a container on the cloud

---

Example: 4CAT vs. script

```{dot}
digraph G {
    laptop [color=red]; 
    laptop -> cloud [label="no"];
    cloud -> SaaS [label="?"]; 
    SaaS [color=red];
    cloud -> container [label="?"];

}
```

::: {.notes}
- runs on laptop? no, multiple people need access + runs over night
- software as a service (SaaS), e.g. Next (with data processing agreement)
