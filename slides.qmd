Research support roles are fluid; researchers are/become supporters and vice versa

**Research software engineer (RSE)**

LCRDM report: [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.15052095.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15052095)

> The role of RSEs varies across Dutch institutions and projects. 
Some are **deeply embedded in research teams**, developing new software and advising researchers...
Others focus on **support and training, guiding researchers on software best practices**, including version control, testing, documentation, and FAIR principles.

> At SURF, we build tools that fit in the workflow of researchers. Our biggest challenge is finding out what researchers actually need and how they can use our tools in their work.

**That's the role of research engineers**

:::

::: {.notes}
- sometimes services/products align with those needs, sometimes not; then we need to solve it
- bridge between IT services and researchers
:::

---

- 1-1 meetings
- Short-term projects: days/weeks
- Long-term projects: infrastructure development

::: {.notes}
concretely:

- Test existing software and services, document
- Connect with (developer) community; collaborations, e.g. UB
- Extend existing software and services
- Build custom software, with focus on self-sufficiency
:::

> We act as a **knowledge hub** where expertise gained in temporary projects are safeguarded and used for cross-pollination across domains.

[Research engineers at Utrecht University](https://www.uu.nl/en/research/research-data-management/support/research-engineers)

::: {.notes}
- recent examples: 
    - research cloud: cost-efficient way to deploy web applications, collaborate
    - android app for controlling movement sensors
- proof of concepts: be ready for when there's a need; modular: small independent components that can be stacked together if needed

# What is research software?

> it \[research software] **contains the research process**: data is collected, read, preprocessed, analyzed, visualized and simulated using research software

**Software is a form of data**

It can be stored, loaded, processed

Used as input or output (of other software)

\--

But: complex type of data

- needs (more) context
- has dependencies
- requires maintenance

::: aside
Netherlands eScience Center, CC-BY 4.0
:::

::: {.notes}
- can only be interpreted in the context of what it does, not on its content alone (-> instructions)
- it is usually dependent on other software (components)
- requires [maintenance](https://esciencecenter-digital-skills.github.io/research-software-support/modules/researchsoftware/slides-software#/4/4), is dynamic
:::

---

**Infrastructure software**

- Programming languages and compilers
- (Generic) software libraries
- Code repositories, data repositories
