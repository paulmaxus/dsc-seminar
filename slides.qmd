## Research Infrastructure Roles

## Research software engineer

- Researchers are not (necessarily) hired for their technical skills
- RSE is often used as a catch-all term, but there are more roles!

## Data wrangler
(Like a data engineer, but not exactly)

- Data retrieval (scraping, databases), wrangling, analysis
- Data pipelines and infrastructure (+ privacy and security)

## What is a RAM?

## And in practice?

Constraints

- Funding might not allow for hiring specialist roles
- Ongoing projects require a number of specific skills
- Needs might change, projects and people come and go

## So?
(Discussion)

- Hire people based on interests; diversity is key (within and between)
- Room (and time) to grow into the role


## What is a research engineer then?

- Not just software (also hardware, consulting, documentation)
- More than 2-3 projects (PoCs!), no research focus necessarily
- Crossover of RSE, data wrangler, research application manager


## Decision tree

- Find existing software/solution; promote
- Preferrably open-source and active
- Find the developers maintainers; connect
- Proof of concept for current case
- Extend/Improve existing software
- Build custom script/software

---

## Proof of concepts

- Be ready for when there's a need
- Lab philosophy: experimenting, testing
- Modular! 
    - Small independent components that can be stacked together if needed

What's the point of having one complex piece of software if the project ends.

## Demo: SCED-meta

Database(s) for meta studies
- What are their needs, skills, budget?

---

Turns out that other projects needed a similar solution

- cheap database, easy to maintain
- 2FA on Research Cloud
- website (hosting)

---

## Summary: challenges

- Good documentation: *Zijn de handleidingen nog te lezen?* ^[Marleen Stikker (2025) in Het Uur [podcast]. NRC]
- Compromises: "does not do exactly what I need"
- Costs
