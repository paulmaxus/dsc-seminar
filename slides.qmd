# Research Infrastructure Roles

# Research software engineer

[LCRDM report](https://zenodo.org/records/15052095):

The role of RSEs varies across Dutch institutions and projects. 
Some are deeply embedded in research teams, **developing new software and advising researchers**

... Others focus on **support and training, guiding researchers on software best practices**, including version control, testing, documentation, and FAIR principles.

::: {.notes}
This role (and research support roles in general) are hard to capture with a single title

https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/collaboration/research-infrastructure-roles/rse
:::

# Other roles

Data wrangler, Research application manager, Data steward

## Data wrangler

![](images/data-wrangler.jpg){height="450" fig-align="center"}

::: {.notes}

- Data science and engineering, but with a broader view on data management, privacy and security)

:::

## RAM

![](images/research-application-managers.jpg){height="450" fig-align="center"}

::: {.notes}
- promote and extend existing software, community

https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/collaboration/research-infrastructure-roles/ram

# And in practice? {visibility="hidden"}

Constraints

- Funding might not allow for hiring specialist roles
- Ongoing projects require a number of specific skills
- Needs might change, projects and people come and go

# Research engineer at FMG

RSE, data wrangler & research application manager?

*This variety in roles reflects the diverse ways institutions have implemented RSE positions, tailored to their local research needs*

[Matthijs Moed (SURF)](https://blog.esciencecenter.nl/open-science-festival-what-infrastructures-do-we-need-to-preserve-research-software-7c181404f310)

> We build tools that fit in the workflow of researchers. Our biggest challenge is finding out what researchers actually need and how they can use our tools in their work.

**That's the role of research engineers**

::: {.notes}
- sometimes (SURF) products align with those needs, sometimes not; then we need to solve it
- bridge between IT services and researchers
:::

# Research engineer at FMG

- 1-1 meetings
- Short-term projects: days/weeks
- Long-term projects: infrastructure development

---

## Workflow {visibility="hidden"}

- Find existing software (active, open-source)
- Connect with developers/community
- Proof of concepts
- Extend existing software
- Build custom software

---

*We act as a **knowledge hub** where expertise gained in temporary projects are safeguarded and used for cross-pollination across domains.*

[Research engineers at Utrecht University](https://www.uu.nl/en/research/research-data-management/support/research-engineers)

::: {.notes}
- recent examples: 
    - research cloud: cost-efficient way to deploy web applications, collaborate
    - android app for controlling movement sensors
- proof of concepts: be ready for when there's a need; modular: small independent components that can be stacked together if needed

# What is research software?

*it \[research software] **contains the research process**: data is collected, read, preprocessed, analyzed, visualized and simulated using research software*
(LCRDM report)

## Software is a form of data

- can be stored, loaded, processed
- used as input or output (of other software)
- complex type of data
    - needs (more) context
    - has dependencies
    - requires maintenance

::: aside

:::

::: {.notes}
- can only be interpreted in the context of what it does, not on its content alone (-> instructions)
- it is usually dependent on other software (components)
- requires [maintenance](https://esciencecenter-digital-skills.github.io/research-software-support/modules/researchsoftware/slides-software#/4/4), is dynamic
:::

# Infrastructure software

- Programming languages and compilers
- (Generic) software libraries
- Code repositories, data repositories

We need to understand:

- software fundamentals
- software management

In order to:

- Make informed decisions
- Solve (small) issues
- Acknowledge open-source

# The Carpentries

What is [the Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/about-us/)?

**Foundational coding and data science skills for research**

- open, community-built lessons
    - learn-by-doing 
    - live-coding
- train the trainer
- network, community

# What can you learn in 4 days?

![](images/carpentries_pre_post.png){height="450" fig-align="center"}

::: {.notes}
- tendency for improving self-sufficiency skills

Other feedback:

- comfortable learning environment
- less so: immediate applicability


# Digital literacy

*As the student begins assembling their resources for the assignment, they may not be able to conveniently locate the relevant information if it is spread across web-based organizational tools, a variety of personal computer locations and devices, and bookmarked web pages*

## "Where is my software running?"

**Understanding (infrastructure) software as components**

... [of instruments](https://blog.esciencecenter.nl/defining-the-roles-of-research-software-21535a43f23)

- instruments: MRI-scanner, data donation (virtual)
- software components: UI, server, database, ...

<!--
*Or more generally, research software components organize, serve, and provide access to data*
-->

::: {.notes}
- What applies to data (previous slide), also applies to software
- Understanding components improves
    - Solving problems self-suffciently
    - Awareness regarding maintenance and security/privacy

# Challenges {visibility="hidden"}

<img src="images/Labyrint_barvaux.jpg" height="200">

- lack of (good) documentation
- terminology
